An archive of the 2019 Young ICT Explorers Years 11-12 National Finals' winning project created by [Rachel Chiong](http://www.github.com/rachelChiong) and Josephine Clough. This project was created in 2019-2020 across two digital solutions projects. The Brisbane Girls Grammar School Digital Art Gallery Project features an accessible art gallery public-facing website, built on the Athena database management system for implementation in the school's esteemed suite of websites.

The final solution needs to be run on a database implemented in AMPPS using php v7.3.

## Libraries Used
The BGGS Art Gallery system utilised several different libraries:
- _H5P_: Used to generate the 360&#176; Art Gallery image
- _Google Maps API_: Used to display locations
- _MapHilight_: Used for the interactive school map to indicate building selection
- _Bootstrap_: Styles for the _Athena_ administration panel
- _MeekroDB_: Used to simplify and secure SQL queries
