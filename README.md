## Project Overview
Brisbane Girls’ Grammar School has an extensive art collection that includes fine arts, ceramics, photographs and more. The school wishes to manage and enhance this growing catalogue. A dynamic online gallery would allow for both the school community and the general public to view the school’s artworks and their related information such as the artist, title, media and location. It is hoped that the online presence would provide information for research purposes and encourage future donations of artworks to the school.

Following the development of the online gallery this project also proposes a dedicated web-based art collection management system that can be accessed by the art curator and facilities staff. The user interface of the management system should allow CRUD operations so that the art curator can easily create, read, update and delete artwork records entered into the database.


The final solution needs to be run on a database implemented in AMPPS using php v7.3.

## Libraries Used
The BGGS Art Gallery system utilised several different libraries:
- _H5P_: Used to generate the 360&#176; Art Gallery image
- _Google Maps API_: Used to display locations
- _MapHilight_: Used for the interactive school map to indicate building selection
- _Bootstrap_: Styles for the _Athena_ administration panel
- _MeekroDB_: Used to simplify and secure SQL queries
